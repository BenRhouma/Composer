Composer, the next gen graphical language 
==

this project aims to create and simplify writing java programs (jobs) or may be scala in the future, 

It's because some guys like me are lazy that I/We come up with this idea, I have tried so many technologies in the market
, but all of them has some missing parts, So 

Goal:

the project contain 2 main parts,

***Runtime Part 
***Graphic Part

There is so many enhancements that we could do, if you are interested in please join me

Roadmap:

1- build a solid engine called xos that create and compose java components from command line or from a scala/java main.
2- build a graphical web/standalone application that exploit xos in order to build java jobs


features:
- Build maven/gradle/sbt project from generated sources
- fully customisable components using external editor (exploit javaPoet or Roaster-api).
- using external context via typesafe config library.
- Created jobs are save in one and only json file, even ui data (X,Y,H,W)
- Every job generate one or many java files depending on the used components.
